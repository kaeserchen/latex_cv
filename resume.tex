\section{Motivation}
I am a software engineer and researcher in computer vision. Currently I lead a small team at Google building new input and interaction technology for virtual and augmented reality. My main motivation is building things to capture and recreate moments that matter in life.

\section{Experience}

                {Senior Software Engineer, Tech Lead / Manager}
	        {2013-present}
	        {Mountain View, CA}
	        {I lead a small engineering team in Daydream (Google VR) exploring 
		 new ways for input and interaction in VR. We work at the 
		 intersection of computer vision, machine learning (neural networks
         	 in particular), and HCI, in order to build new input methods to 
		 make VR feel even more immersive. \\
		 \newline
		 Prior to that, I was: \\
	         \textbullet ~ Founding team member of Google Cardboard. \\
                 \textbullet ~ Software engineer in Android working on new Camera features and other core apps. \\

	        {Flutter was an app where users can use hand gestures to control media playback on computers: \\
                 \textbullet ~ Investigating new computer vision features, and 
		               improving machine learning algorithms for gesture detection \\
                 \textbullet ~ Develping new User interactions. \\}

	        {I worked in the video processing team at Disney Research Zurich.: \\
                 \textbullet ~ Developed an interactive control platform using 
		               multi-touch screens for a computational stereoscopic camera system. \\
                 \textbullet ~ Co-authored the stereoscopic control algorithms for the 
		               computational camera system.}
